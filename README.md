# Mobile App Ratings 

The top 10 rated apps gather 90% of category revenue, all the rest compete for the remaining 10 percent.

With data extracted from the itunes data from Kaggle, this project explores the non-language and language features that predict app user ratings.

**Problem statement:**

Can we identify novel features and key trends that predict user ratings of apps? 

**Task:**

- Exploratory and visual analysis 
- Binary classification 

**Key challenges:**
- Foreign apps 
- Engineering novel features to predict user app ratings (extracting language features from app description and name) 

**Results:**
- 70% score with GradBoost
- 60% score with Gradboost and Logistic Regression (when popularity/previous user rating counts were removed) 
- Need further work to optimise this
