# Mobile App Ratings 

The top 10 rated apps gather 90% of category revenue, all the rest compete for the remaining 10 percent.

With data extracted from the itunes data from Kaggle, this project explores the non-language and language features that predict app user ratings.

**Problem statement:**

Can we identify novel features and key trends that predict user ratings of apps? 

**Task:**

- Exploratory and visual analysis 

**Key challenges:**
- Outliers 
- Foreign apps 
- Engineering novel features to predict user app ratings (extracting language features from app description and name)
