# Mobile App Ratings 

App user ratings play an important role in app revenue. 

If your app has low ratings, its search position tends to be low. The top 10 rated apps gather 90% of category revenue, all the rest compete for the remaining 10 percent.

With data extracted from the itunes data from Kaggle, this project explores the non-language and language features that predict app user ratings.

**Problem statement:**

Can we identify features and key trends that predict user ratings of apps? 

**Task:**

EDA and visualisation 

**Key challenges:**
- Outliers 
- Foreign apps 
- Engineering novel features to predict user app ratings (extracting language features from app description and name)
